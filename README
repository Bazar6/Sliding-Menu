= Sliding Menu
This is a simple sliding menu using only html, css and javascript.

It has NOT been tested for all browsers (it seemd to work on webkit :D), so use it at your own discrition

See the index.html file for a demo

== USAGE
To use it, you will need to have an html list (either ul or ol), with valid HTML.
It can have nested lists, but has not been tested with other elements than ul, ol and li.

You will also need to include jquery and jquery-ui before using this plugin (jquery plugin provides an easing method, and can be removed if the easing option is removed from the slide_moving_container function)

Then you can use the js function sliding_menu(jquery_seletor)

You will also probably want to override the on_select function or change it completely, and add the corresponding css and images, or create your own
